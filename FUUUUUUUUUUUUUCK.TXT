
    Looks like I was looking at a __OLD__ version of
    the engine when I did my code review, because 
    the engine does __NOT__ actually run because
    of an error.

    You will see message :

        _READ_NOT_FLEX_1007_

    Which means that the function is being called
    with an object it does not recognize.


        Read Not Flex , as in , the function takes
        parameters for READABILITY __NOT__ FLEXIBILITY .
